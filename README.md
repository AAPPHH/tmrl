## Real-Time Gym Environment
This project is built with our threaded OpenAI Gym framework for real-world applications.

Our threaded Gym framework enables efficient real-time implementations of Delayed Markov Decision Processes in real-world applications.
It can be reused fairly easily by creating an ad-hoc interface for your application, e.g. see the TM2020Interface class for an example.

The core mechanisms of the threaded Gym framework can be visually described as follows:
